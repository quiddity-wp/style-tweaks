Some random userstyles and userscripts

To use: 
1. Install Stylus: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) / [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne/)
2. Open the file you want to try (above) and click the "Raw" button to install it in Stylus. They're easy to turn off/delete.

Note: Old versions (abandoned) but with some screenshots are at [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/users/302314)
